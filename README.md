This project is built using core web development technologies, leveraging HTML for structure, CSS for visual design and animations, and JavaScript for the game logic and interaction.
It's a great way to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript while focusing on responsive design using CSS.
How to Play ?
1.Start the Game: 
        When you load the game, you'll see a grid of (16 cards = 8 pairs)face-down cards.

2.Flip Two Cards: 
        Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal the images underneath.

3.Check for a Match:
        If the two cards you flipped over match (they show the same image), they will stay face up.
        If the two cards do not match, they will flip back to face down after a short delay, giving you time to memorize their positions.
4.Continue Flipping: 
        Keep flipping pairs of cards and trying to find matches.

5.Track Your Progress:
   Timer: 
        The game tracks how long it takes you to complete. Challenge yourself to improve your time!
   Score:
        For each correct match, you earn 10 points.
   Winning the Game: 
        The game ends when all the pairs have been matched and all cards are face up. At the end of the game, your total Scores and time will be displayed.
6.Restart: 
        To start a new game during play, press the restart button.
        After completing the game, it will restart automatically.
